# ðŸ†Ž A/B Testing
This project was developed to learning more about Hypothesis Tests.
This project was divided into:
1. Data treatments of  [A/B testing base extracted directly from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmotefaker/ab-testing-dataset)
2. Hypothesis tests. In this part, I used [this Kaggle page]([https://www.kaggle.com/code/nancy248/amazon-sales-analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yaminh/data-driven-ab-testing-for-marketing-excellence/notebook)) as reference
